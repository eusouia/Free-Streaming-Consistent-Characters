# Free-Streaming-Consistent-Characters
[FREE WORKFLOWS] Create your own CONSISTENT characters with AI!
The Flux Consistent Characters workflow, created by Mickmumpitz, is a powerful ComfyUI tool that maintains the consistency of AI-generated characters across multiple outputs. Ideal for AI-driven cinematics, children‚Äôs books, or any project that requires stable character appearances, this Flux-based workflow simplifies the process of achieving consistent character appearances, reducing the need for multiple prompts and fine-tuning. 
Mickmumpitz developed the Flux Consistent Characters workflow and shared a detailed tutorial on his YouTube channel. While the workflow and environment setup are provided here for convenience, Mickmumpitz deserves full credit for creating this effective Flux-based Consistent Characters solution.

You can also use any other SDXL checkpoints for all the workflows. I recommend Turbo or lightning ones though for faster generation time especially for the video workflows. You can find more models on CivitAI.com. Check the example images for the settings and match them in your KSampler!

For Training I recommend using FluxGym via Pinokio. 

You can also train Loras online via Replicate for example. Cost 2-5 Dollars for one Lora.
